  A
  Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
text: |-
  <p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the
  bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur
  clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and
  uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had
  a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
  natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as
  if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long
  argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only
  say, “I’m older than you, and must know better.” And this Alice
  would not allow, without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory
  positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be
  said.</p>
  <p>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among
  them, called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll
  soon make you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large
  ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously
  fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she
  did not get dry very soon.</p>
  <p>“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air. “Are you all
  ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you
  please! ‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the
  pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and
  had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin
  and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria——’”</p>
  <p>“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.</p>
  <p>“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very
  politely. “Did you speak?”</p>
  <p>“Not I!” said the Lory, hastily.</p>
  <p>“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “I proceed. ‘Edwin and
  Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him; and
  even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it
  advisable——’”</p>
  <p>“Found what?” said the Duck.</p>
  <p>“Found it,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you
  know what ‘it’ means.”</p>
  <p>“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when I find a thing,” said
  the Duck: “it’s generally a frog, or a worm. The question is, what
  did the archbishop find?”</p>
  <p>The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,
  “‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and
  offer him the crown. William&#39;s conduct at first was moderate. But
  the insolence of his Normans——’ How are you getting on now, my
  dear?” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.</p>
  <p>“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t
  seem to dry me at all.”</p>
  <p>“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I
  move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
  energetic remedies——”</p>
  <p>“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don&#39;t know the meaning of
  half those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do
  either!” And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of
  the other birds tittered audibly.</p>
  <p>“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone,
  “was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a
  Caucus-race.”</p>
  <p>“What is a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she much wanted to
  know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought
  to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p>
  <p>“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.”
  (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter-day,
  I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p>
  <p>First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the
  exact shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were
  placed along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two,
  three, and away!”, but they began running when they liked, and left
  off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race
  was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so,
  and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is
  over!”, and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But
  who has won?”</p>
  <p>This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
  thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
  its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in
  the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the
  Dodo said, “Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.”</p>
  <p>“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices
  asked.</p>
  <p>“Why, she, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
  finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out,
  in a confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”</p>
  <p>Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in
  her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt water
  had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was
  exactly one a-piece, all round.</p>
  <p>“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the
  Mouse.</p>
  <p>“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you
  got in your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.</p>
  <p>“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.</p>
  <p>“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.</p>
  <p>Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo
  solemnly presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of
  this elegant thimble”; and, when it had finished this short speech,
  they all cheered.</p>
  <p>Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked
  so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not
  think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,
  looking as solemn as she could.</p>
  <p>The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise
  and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not
  taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the
  back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a
  ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p>
  <p>“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice,
  “and why it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half
  afraid that it would be offended again.</p>
  <p>“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to
  Alice, and sighing.</p>
  <p>“It is a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with
  wonder at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she
  kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her
  idea of the tale was something like this:—</p>
  <p>“Fury said to a</p>
  <p>mouse, That he</p>
  <p>met in the</p>
  <p>house,</p>
  <p>‘Let us</p>
  <p>both go to</p>
  <p>law: I will</p>
  <p>prosecute</p>
  <p>you.—Come,</p>
  <p>I’ll take no</p>
  <p>denial: We</p>
  <p>must have a</p>
  <p>trial; For</p>
  <p>really this</p>
  <p>morning I’ve</p>
  <p>nothing</p>
  <p>to do.’</p>
  <p>Said the</p>
  <p>mouse to the</p>
  <p>cur, ‘Such</p>
  <p>a trial,</p>
  <p>dear sir,</p>
  <p>With</p>
  <p>no jury</p>
  <p>or judge,</p>
  <p>would be</p>
  <p>wasting</p>
  <p>our</p>
  <p>breath.’</p>
  <p>‘I’ll be</p>
  <p>judge, I’ll</p>
  <p>be jury,’</p>
  <p>Said</p>
  <p>cunning</p>
  <p>old Fury:</p>
  <p>‘I’ll</p>
  <p>try the</p>
  <p>whole</p>
  <p>cause,</p>
  <p>and</p>
  <p>condemn</p>
  <p>you</p>
  <p>to</p>
  <p>death’.”</p>
  <p>“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice, severely.
  “What are you thinking of?”</p>
  <p>“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the
  fifth bend, I think?”</p>
  <p>“I had not!” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p>
  <p>“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and
  looking anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”</p>
  <p>“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and
  walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”</p>
  <p>“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily
  offended, you know!”</p>
  <p>The Mouse only growled in reply.</p>
  <p>“Please come back, and finish your story!” Alice called after
  it. And the others all joined in chorus “Yes, please do!” But the
  Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little
  quicker.</p>
  <p>“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it
  was quite out of sight. And an old Crab took the opportunity of
  saying to her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you
  never to lose your temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young
  Crab, a little snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an
  oyster!”</p>
  <p>“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,
  addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”</p>
  <p>“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said
  the Lory.</p>
  <p>Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about
  her pet: “Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for
  catching mice, you ca’n’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her
  after the birds! Why, she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at
  it!”</p>
  <p>This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some
  of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping
  itself up very carefully, remarking “I really must be getting home:
  the night-air doesn’t suit my throat!” And a Canary called out in a
  trembling voice, to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high
  time you were all in bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off,
  and Alice was soon left alone.</p>
  <p>“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a
  melancholy tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure
  she&#39;s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I
  shall ever see you any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry
  again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little
  while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in
  the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse
  had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.</p>
